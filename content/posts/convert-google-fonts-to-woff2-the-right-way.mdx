Google Fonts is a great resource for typefaces. It is a well-established platofrm and the web app is a joy do use. However if we want to self-host the fonts we download, which we should do [according to Google](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/web-performance-made-easy), the default download from Google Fonts is TTF.

TTF is rather on the large side in terms of filesize. What we really want to be using is the optimized WOFF2 format. Now if we search for conversion tools we are presented with a plethora of online tools, some good and some very bad.

There is however a handy command line tool that does the job for us called [fontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools); a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python.

Sure there are other resoures out there that provide already converted fonts, but if you are like me and wish to use variable fonts from a trusted source then this is the best way to go about it.

## Steps

1. Download your chosen fonts from Google Fonts.

2. Navigate to the directory the fonts are located.

3. Check if you have Python installed with `python --version`. If not, go ahead and install python 3 with Homebrew.

```shell
brew install python3
```

4. Python comes with Pip package manager preinstalled. Pip is to Python like npm is to JavaScript. Install FontTools.

```shell
pip install fonttools
```

5. Convert your fonts using the followig commands.

```shell
$ python3
>>> from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
>>> f = TTFont('path/file.ttf')
>>> f.flavor='woff2'
>>> f.save('path/file.woff2')
```

And that's it! Now you can have nicely compressed fonts in WOFF2 format via an efficient algorithm using a respected command line tool.

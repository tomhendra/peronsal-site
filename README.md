# A Fresh Start with Next.JS + Theme UI + MDX.

**Frontend**: Moving away from Gatsby & Emotion, because Next.js & Theme UI are more evolved tools.
**CMS**: Moving away from Sanity.io because it was overkill for this project. The monorepo / API route requires more dev & maintenance, is less lightweight & less dev-friendly than MDX. Plus Tina looks like fun to play with! üöÇ

**References**:

- MDNEXT blog starter from [Domitrius Clark](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext).
- TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier config from [Paulin Trognon](https://paulintrognon.fr/blog/typescript-prettier-eslint-next-js).
- Jest & Testing Library config from [Fr√©d√©rick Morin](https://github.com/freddydumont/theme-ui-next-boilerplate).

**TO KEEP AS LIGHTWEIGHT AS POSSIBLE FOR QUICK REFACTORS, WHILST LEARNING REACT PROPERLY & PRACTISING KENT C DODD'S TEACHINGS ON THIS PROJECT!**

## Issues

### Theme UI doesn't support automatic runtime in React 17 yet:

- [Issue #1160](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1160#issuecomment-715530924).
- [Issue #1239](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1239).

Options:

1. Stick with React v16.13.1. & wait for Theme UI v0.5.0.
2. Upgrade to React v17.0.1 & use Theme UI 0.5.0-alpha.1. ‚òëÔ∏è

Notes:

sx prop usage still throws TS error with 0.5.0-alpha.1:
`Property 'sx' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes &...`

  Portfolio website
</h1>

My **[portfolio](https://tomhendra.dev)** is built with Gatsby using a React hooks pattern learned from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby/). 

_This readme is mostly for me to document & retain the process, since this is my first Gatsby site!_ ðŸš€

## Getting started

The Gatsby website has a really easy to understand **[tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)** to get things kicked off with dependencies etc. Awesome stuff!

## We dives into the codeage

1.  **Gatsby setup.**

    Bare bones are built using the Gatsby CLI to create a new site.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the built in cli
    gatsby new portfolio
    ```
    
    Navigate into the new directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
    The site is running at `http://localhost:8000`

    _There's also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool to experiment with querying data with GraphQL._

    Yeah. That's it! 

2.  **Navigation.**

    Site navigation uses Reach router's Link already build in to Gatsby. Reach is an awesome tool, because it puts accessibility at the forefront. Kudos to **[Reach](https://reach.tech/router)**. 

    # make your import at the top of the js file.
    `import { Link } from 'gatsby';`

    # Use as as you see fit.
    `<Link to="about/">about</Link>`

3.  **emotion css-in-js.**

    Styled with the wonderful **[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)** library.
    
    ```sh
    # Install these dependencies and you're good to go!
    npm i @emotion/core @emotion/styled gatsby-plugin-emotion
    ```

# A Fresh Start with Next.JS + Theme UI + MDX.

**Frontend**: Moving away from Gatsby & Emotion, because Next.js & Theme UI are more evolved tools.
**CMS**: Moving away from Sanity.io because it was overkill for this project. The monorepo / API route requires more dev & maintenance, is less lightweight & less dev-friendly than MDX. Plus Tina looks like fun to play with! üöÇ

**References**:

- MDNEXT blog starter from [Domitrius Clark](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext).
- TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier config from [Paulin Trognon](https://paulintrognon.fr/blog/typescript-prettier-eslint-next-js).
- Jest & Testing Library config from [Fr√©d√©rick Morin](https://github.com/freddydumont/theme-ui-next-boilerplate).

## Done

- Created new branch `legacy` as a backup of `main`.
- Created new branch `next` to move forward with NextJS.
- Deleted old Vercel deployments from GitHub repo.
- Deleted old Vercel project and created a fresh one.
- Copied blog posts from Sanity to MDX files.
- Tested config for prettier, eslint, husky & lint-staged for TS environment.
- Tested POC of Theme UI + Framer Motion + next-mdx-remote + React 17.0.1.
- Hacked apart more advanced MDNEXT Reflex.js example to understand data + ideas & inspiration.

## TODO Now

Cleared the list ✅

## TODO Later

- refactor: Accessibility sweep
- feat: Investigate [Cloudflare R2](https://blog.cloudflare.com/r2-open-beta/) + [Imgix](https://imgix.com/) for images because...
  - [this comment](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/2905#discussioncomment-2686431) makes sense.
  - I don't like Cloudinary DX very much - not sure what all the fuss is about.
  - I prefer to store everything on Cloudflare's platform anyway, and Imgix isn't a host.
  - Testing Imgix examples seems to be faster (check this again)

## Things I like about Svelte & SvelteKit

- Sprinkling in TS or Sass with `lang="ts" or lang="scss"`
- Native collocation of components and styles
- Page and layout components can have a load function which runs on the server
  to fetch data before the component is created
- @lib baked in
- It feels closer to using the native web platform than a framework
- Animations have first class support
- Vite is a great

## Commit Types

Commitlint is unnecessary but good habits should be formed

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

## TODO

### Look for [breaking changes](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md)

1. revisit flexbox module in CSS for JS Devs & see if layout can be improved.

## MAYBE LATER

1. work out a better way to handle dark mode preferences, perhaps with cookies.
2. move posts to content directory so as to mimic external CMS.
3. save a stripped out version of this project as a starter, once finished.
4. add an easter egg to console.
5. Play with CMS's to see if it improves the writing experience

# A Fresh Start with Next.JS + Stitches + Forestry.io || Tina

**Frontend**: Moving away from Gatsby & Emotion, because Next.js & Theme UI are more evolved tools.
**CMS**: Moving away from Sanity.io to Forestry because Sanity was overkill for this project. The monorepo / API route requires more dev & maintenance, is less lightweight & less dev-friendly than Git / markdown. Plus Tina looks like fun to play with! üôÇ

**References**:

- MDNEXT starter from [Domitrius Clark](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext).
- Next JS blog starter with TS from [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript).

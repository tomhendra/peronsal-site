## Things I like about Svelte & SvelteKit

- Sprinkling in TS or Sass with `lang="ts" or lang="scss"`
- Collocation of components and styles
- Page and layout components can have a load function which runs on the server
  to fetch data before the component is created
- @lib baked in
- It feels closer to native web platform APIs than to a framework
- Animations have first class support
- Vite has great DX

## TODO

1. revisit flexbox module in CSS for JS Devs & see if layout can be improved.
2. accessibility health check.

## MAYBE LATER

1. work out a better way to handle dark mode preferences, perhaps with cookies.
2. save a stripped out version of this project as a starter, once finished.
3. add an easter egg to console.

# A Fresh Start with Next.JS + Theme UI + MDX.

**Frontend**: Moving away from Gatsby & Emotion, because Next.js & Theme UI are
more evolved tools. **CMS**: Moving away from Sanity.io because it was overkill
for this project. The monorepo / API route requires more dev & maintenance, is
less lightweight & less dev-friendly than MDX. Plus Tina looks like fun to play
with! üöÇ

## Issues

### Theme UI doesn't support automatic runtime in React 17 yet:

- [Issue #1160](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1160#issuecomment-715530924).
- [Issue #1239](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1239).

Options:

1. Stick with React v16.13.1. & wait for Theme UI v0.5.0.
2. Upgrade to React v17.0.1 & use Theme UI 0.5.0-alpha.x.
3. Use Tailwind CSS instead! ‚òëÔ∏è

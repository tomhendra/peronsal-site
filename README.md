# A Fresh Start with Next.JS + Stitches + Forestry.io || Tina

**Frontend**: Moving away from Gatsby & Emotion, because Next.js & Stitches are more evolved tools.
**CMS**: Moving away from Sanity.io to Forestry because Sanity was overkill for this project. The monorepo / API route requires more dev & maintenance, is less lightweight & less dev-friendly than Git / markdown. Plus Tina looks like fun to play with! ðŸ™‚

Starters used for kicking things off:

- Next JS blog starter with TS from [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript).
- Next JS blog starter with Stitches from [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-stitches).
- Next JS blog starter from Vercel adapted by [Forestry](https://github.com/forestryio/next-blog-forestry).

The following examples are being used on recommendation by the Stitches docs: "to find inspiration, ideas and design patterns on how to use Stitches in a real-world application".

- Design System from [Modulz](https://github.com/modulz/design-system/).
- Stitches site from [Modulz](https://github.com/modulz/stitches-site).

## Done

- Created new branch `legacy` as a backup of `main`.
- Created new branch `next`.
- Deleted old Vercel deployments from GitHub repo.
- Deleted old Vercel project and created a fresh one.
- Copied blog posts from Sanity to markdown.

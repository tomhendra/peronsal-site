<hr />

I love building stuff for the web and making it look fancy.

I'm proud to be a career changer, having journeyed from commercial print procurement to writing code for a living.

I'm also completely obsessed with good quality food, so the Spanish lifestyle suits me well!

If you like the look of my work and want to chat, drop me an email at [hola@tomhendra.dev](mailto:hola@tomhendra.dev) and I will get back to you in a jiffy. ðŸ™‚
